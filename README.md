# Laravel React Typescript Boilerplate

An opinionated boilerplate based on Laravel 5.6, React 16 and Typescript empowering you to get off the ground quickly without excessive fiddling with npm, webpack, laravel configuration files.

## Included:
* Laravel 5.6
* React 16.*
* Hot Module Reloading (npm run dev)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)
* [Mobx & Mobx React](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10)
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/)
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)
* [FontAwesome 5](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* [Laravel CRUD Generator](https://github.com/appzcoder/crud-generator)
* [Emotion CSS-in-JS Library](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
* Admin Middleware (See Below)

## Notes:
#### Admin Middleware

In config/auth.php add the emails of 'Admins' to the admins array.
This allows you to easily restrict access to certain routes whereby the user's email is not in the admins array using the admin middleware.
```
Route::get('admin/profile', function () {
    //
})->middleware('admin');
```

The admin middleware file is located at:
```
App\Http\Middleware\Admin
```

#### Frontend Files
Frontend files are placed in /frontend rather than:

/resources/assets/js, and
/resources/assets/sass

I think this makes more sense when your application is more frontend/javascript heavy than mere jquery sprinkled over blade views.

## Scripts
#### Hot Module Reloading and Development:
``` npm run dev ```

#### Production Development:
``` npm run production ```
To use your built files you must set your Larave APP_ENV to production.

## Work in Progress
If you fix these, submitting a PR or Issue with the code would be appreciated.
* Tailwind CSS requires bringing in an external script in app.blade.php.
* Purge CSS or UnCSS integration, I have made a start on Purge CSS.
    * This must take into account Ant Design.
